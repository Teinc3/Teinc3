So, this was my previous commit history, cached just a few days before the time of writing:
<img width="432" height="518" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 11 41 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/debdd3ba-c26a-4fa8-aa35-2ffe299f7fe2" />

And guess what, I removed my high school email from my account, without realising that essentially my commit history would be completely gut too.
And the problem is, it has expired for around 2 years already, and the web administrator refused to let me restore it just for a brief moment.

So yeah, now I only have like 400 commits. But everything does make sense here.
At least I'm glad that I saved up evidence and can tell you why that happened.
If you're looking for sustained activity in my account, at least I can prove it to you this way, the hard way.
